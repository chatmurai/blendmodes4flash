=Getting Started with Blend Modes 4 Flash=

==Using the UltimateBlendModeShader SWC with CS4==

If you have Flash CS4 installed a SWC can be referenced from your FLA. 
Go to File > Publish settings > Flash > Settings
Then choose the tab 'Library path' and click the plus icon and select the UltimateBlendModeShader.swc file.

==Applying custom blend modes with Actionscript to DisplayObjects==
Once the UltimateBlendModeShader.swc is referenced in your FLA or your Flex Project you may apply custom blend modes in the following manners. 

1) Using Static references to custom blend modes
{{{
import flash.display.BlendModeShader;

myDisplayObject.blendShader = BlendModeShader.SOFTLIGHT;
}}}

2) Using constructed instances of custom blend modes
{{{
import flash.display.BlendModeShader;

myDisplayObject.blendShader = new BlendModeSoftlight();
}}}

==Altering custom blend modes with Actionscript==
Custom blend modes have 2 parameters which you can tweak to get a desired result. These parameters are alpha and multiply. 

===The alpha parameter===
The alpha parameter undoes the blend shader to the source image where 0 is undone and 1 is the custom blend shader completely applied. 

===The multiply parameter===
The multiply parameter exaggerates the blend shader effect. This can be thought of as similar to a process you may consider doing via applying the same custom blend shader onto duplicates of the same DisplayObject.
